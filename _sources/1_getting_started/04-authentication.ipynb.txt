    "All software systems implemented in the GEOAnalytics Canada Platform require users to be authenticated before access is given. The GEOAnalytics platform uses LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) to store user information and allow users to authenticate and log into the platform. Hatfield has also implemented a single sign-on (SSO) system based on the industry-standard OAuth 2 protocol, where you, the user, only needs to login to the platform once to gain access of all platform functions. Using this SSO system, an API token is given when you first login and is validated by platform services when accessed by you. \n",
