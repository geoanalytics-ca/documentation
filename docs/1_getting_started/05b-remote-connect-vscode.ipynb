    "Moving your algorithms (code) to execute close to the data you are processing (while minimizing data movement) is a key part of scalable data processing. To allow code and algorithms that are on your local computer to be executed on GeoAnalytics Canada, you can setup your locally installed Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to leverage SSH connections. This will enable you to execute on your GeoAnaltytics Canada Remote Desktop using an SSH tunnel thereby allowing you access to all of GeoAnalytics Canadaâ€™s processing infrastructure through a local IDE. This tutorial will go over how to use VSCode (open source) to connect to our Remote Desktops."
