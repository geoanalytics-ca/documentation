    "**What is Dask?**\n",
    "Dask is a distributed system which can scale efficiently from a single computer to hundreds of servers. Dask uses regular Python code and Python APIS to scale the work for existing python structures (like NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes) in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should we scale?**\n",
    "Computations are much faster when data can be held in local memory. Most computers do not have massive memory storages to store big data, those that do are extremely expensive. An easier and cost effective method is to use the pool of memory from a collections of systems to store large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram representing the Dask architecture, which consists of the Dask Clusters, a proxy for connecting the user's client with the scheduler, and the main Gateway for authentication and cluster management.\n",
