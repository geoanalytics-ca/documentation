Introduction
-----------
Research on climate-change, ecosystem modeling, and environmental and natural resources monitoring is based on the collection, management, analysis, and dissemination of geospatial data. The amount of geospatial data has exploded in recent years, primarily with the availability of open satellite datasets (such as Landsat and Sentinel satellites). 

While more data is usually a good thing, users now cannot use their local computers to find, access, and use the wealth of data now available. This is where GEOAnalytics Canada comes in: we apply powerful cloud-computing technologies to *enable earth-science analytics at-scale*.


How to use this documentation
